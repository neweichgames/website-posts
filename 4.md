I have made the hard decision to stop game development indefinitely. Thank you so much for all the support my games have had over the 10 years of game development! My journey of being a game developer has been a dream come true, but I have decided to pursue other directions now. 

I can’t recommend enough trying game development yourself if you interested in making your games. The skills I have learned from game development have become very useful in other fields of work. When I started game development, I did my best to avoid programming the games because it seemed very hard, but over time the task became easier and became the most fruitful part of game development. I used Unity3d to develop my games, but there are so many great engines these days like Godot. You have my permission to use the ideas from my games if you incorporate your own ideas (I was heavily inspired by Otto Ojala’s Soccer Physics).

I still plan to fix any major bugs that comes to my attention to the games. I will also do my best to respond to my contact email.
